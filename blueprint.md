# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is an interactive 3D modeling application that allows users to generate and view 3D models using natural language prompts.

## Implemented Features

*   **Modern Home Page Design:** A visually appealing and user-friendly home page with a hero section, feature highlights, and a clear call-to-action.
*   **3D Model Generation:** Users can type in the name of a shape (e.g., "cube," "sphere") to generate a 3D model.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The 3D model updates in real-time as the user types a new prompt.
*   **Component-based Architecture:** The application is built with a modern React architecture, with clear separation of concerns between UI, 3D rendering, and state management.
*   **Styling:** The application uses modern styling with CSS, including responsive design elements.
*   **Routing:** The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation between the home page and the 3D view.
*   **Iconography:** The application uses Font Awesome for modern and intuitive icons.

## Current Plan

### Remove AR Functionality

*   **Objective:** Revert the application to a 3D-only experience by removing all AR-related features and dependencies.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Uninstall AR-related npm packages (`@react-three/xr`, `@ar-js-org/ar.js`, `aframe`).
    2.  Remove the `zustand` override from `package.json`.
    3.  Update `ThreePage.jsx` to remove the `ARCanvas` and AR-specific UI and logic.
    4.  Update `HomePage.jsx` to remove the AR feature card.
